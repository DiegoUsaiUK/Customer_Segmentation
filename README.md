# Using K-Means Clustering to Understand Marketing Response

[_Market segmentation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation) refers to the process of dividing a consumer market of existing and/or potential customers into groups (or segments) based on shared attributes, interests, and behaviours.

For this mini-project I will use the popular [__K-Means clustering algorithm__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to segment customers based on their response to a series of __marketing campaigns__. The basic concept is that consumers who share common traits would respond to __marketing communication__ in a similar way so that companies can reach out for each group in a relevant and effective way.

With little effort we will leaarn that _some of our customers favour certain varieties of wine_ whereas _others prefer to buy high or low quantities_. Such information can be used to tailor your __pricing strategies__ and __marketing campaings__ towards those customers that are more inclined to respond. Moreover, customer segmentation allows for a more efficient allocation of marketing resources and the maximization of cross- and up-selling opportunities.

Although it’s not going to give you all the answers, clustering is a powerful exploratory exercise that can help you reveal patterns in your consumer base, especially when you have a brand new market to explore and do not have any prior knowledge of it. It’s very easy to implement and you can unearth interesting patterns of behaviour in your customer base.
